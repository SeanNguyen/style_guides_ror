# WORK IN PROGRESS

Please don't touch it until @brucelihb gather the basic set of our guidelines. Slack him if you have existing document to be added in.

High level guidelines:

* Be consistent.
* Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.
* Don't write code that guesses at future functionality.
* [Keep the code simple](https://jml.io/2012/02/simple-made-easy.html).
* [Do not program "defensively"](http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml#HDR11).

A note on the language:

* "Avoid" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
* "Don't" means there's never a good reason.
* "Prefer" indicates a better option and its alternative to watch out for.
* "Use" is a positive instruction.

# Object-Oriented Design

* Avoid global variables.
* Avoid long parameter lists.
* Limit collaborators of an object (entities an object depends on).
* Limit an object's dependencies (entities that depend on an object).
* Prefer composition over inheritance.
* Prefer small methods. Between one and five lines is best.
* Prefer small classes with a single, well-defined responsibility. When a
  class exceeds 100 lines, it may be doing too many things.
* [Tell, don't ask].
* [Law of Demeter].
* [Coupling].
* Understand SOLID principles
  * [Single Responsibility Principle]
  * [Open-Closed Principle]
  * [Liskov Substitution Principle]
  * [Interface Segregation Principle]
  * [Dependency Inversion Principle]

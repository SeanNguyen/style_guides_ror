# Best practices

These are not to be blindly followed; strive to understand these and ask when in doubt.

## General

* Don't duplicate the functionality of a built-in library.
* Don't swallow exceptions or "fail silently."
* Don't write code that guesses at future functionality.
* Exceptions should be exceptional.
* [Keep the code simple].
* [Do not program "defensively"].

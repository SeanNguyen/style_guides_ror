# Ruby

* Avoid optional parameters. Does the method do too much?
* Avoid monkey-patching.
* Generate necessary [Bundler binstubs] for the project, such as `rake` and
  `rspec`, and add them to version control.
* Prefer classes (delegation) over modules (separation of concerns) over inheritance when
  designing functionality that is shared by multiple models.
* Prefer `private` when indicating scope. Use `protected` only with comparison
  methods like `def ==(other)`, `def <(other)`, and `def >(other)`.
